/**
 * Function: calculate
 * -----------------------------------
 * Given an sizeÃ—size grid (represented as a 1D array board), this function checks all rows, columns,
 * and both diagonals for a sequence of sequence consecutive identical numbers (ignoring zeros).
 *
 * If such a winning sequence is found, the function immediately returns the nonzero value.
 * Otherwise, it checks if any sequence-length line could become a winning sequence in the future
 * (treating 0 as a wildcard). In that case, the function returns 255.
 *
 * If neither a winning sequence nor a future possibility is found, the function returns 0.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   size - the grid size (grid is size x size), must be greater than 2.
 *   sequence - the sequence length to check (0 < sequence <= size).
 *   board - the 1D array of size*size uint8_t containing grid values (each value is in 0..200).
 *
 * @return uint8_t - the winning number, or 255 if a future possibility exists, or 0 if neither.
